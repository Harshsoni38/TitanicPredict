This code analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It starts by loading and cleaning the data, filling in missing values, and creating new features like family size and passenger titles. The code includes visualizations to explore key factors such as age, class, and family dynamics. It then prepares the data for machine learning by converting categorical variables into numerical ones. A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the cleaned training data, and its accuracy is evaluated. Finally, the model makes predictions on the test dataset, presenting the expected survival outcomes for each passenger. This project highlights how data science can provide insights from historical events.
